Handy Invention Tracking System (HITS)

The HITS Web Application allows you to trach all of your bright ideas and innovations through the entire process from the date of creation to your first prototye.  After you create an account, you will have the ability to create a datatbase of all the bright ideas that pop into your head throughout the day.  Then you can then edit each of these pages as your idea grows.  If you are not feeling good about one of youir ideas, you can always delete it from the site and continue to focus on your best ones.
